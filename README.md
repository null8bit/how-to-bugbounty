Hi hello, I'm ssrf (also known as bugbounty), in this tutorial I'm going to show you how to get started with bug bounty from zero. 

Before we start, I want to make a simple promise: making money through bug bounty programs is not easy. Especially in the beginning, your reports may be rejected, and you might not be able to earn a substantial amount. If you are looking for quick and easy money, then this tutorial is not for you.

REQUIREMENTS  
The requirements that I am about to list are crucial as they lay the foundation for developing a strong skill set to start your bug bounty journey  

* * *

[Networking 101](https://github.com/Samsar4/Ethical-Hacking-Labs/blob/master/0-Core-Knowledge/0-Networking-101.md)  (Target: Gain a thorough understanding of the key network concepts essential for ethical hacking)

Alternatives: [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html), [Network+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network), [this repository](https://github.com/facyber/awesome-networking#tcpip-protocols)  

* * *

 [Programming](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) (Target: Learn to code and develop small exploits using one or more programming languages)

Recommended languages: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [SQL](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language), [PHP](https://www.php.net/), [Powershell](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), [Bash](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash), [C](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(linguaggio)), [JavaScript](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/))

PLATFORMS

Okay now let's talk about the different platforms to use. There are two types of bug bounty programs:

\- Public bug bounty programs 

\- Private bug bounty programs

Quite simply, public bug bounty programs are platforms open to everyone such as [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/), [BugCrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/), [Intigriti](https://www.intigriti.com/)  (the last one is good only if you're in Europe).

Benefits:

Companies are obligated to compensate you if a valid vulnerability is discovered.  
 You are more protected.

 You increase your networking and you can be contacted by companies to work with them

 You will be provided with a comprehensive scope encompassing all available domains (transparency) 

Reputation system.  

* * *

Disadvantages:

 Due to the high volume of requests, companies may take a considerable amount of time to respond to you.

 It is possible that one of your reports may be rejected, even if your vulnerability is valid.

High competition

Bug bounty platforms break the direct connection between hackers and developers.
